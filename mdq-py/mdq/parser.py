"""
A basic Markdown parser for the MDQ file format.

This module turns MDQ Markdown source (frontmatter + introduction + body +
epilogue, as described in ``docs/question-types/generic.md``) into the same
dict shape that ``mdq.validator.validate_document`` expects, i.e. the
shape documented by ``schema/*.yaml``.

Design notes
------------
We use ``markdown-it-py`` to get *block*-level structure (paragraphs,
headings, bullet lists) because that part of CommonMark -- what starts a
new block, when a list interrupts a paragraph, etc. -- is exactly the kind
of thing not worth reimplementing. But MDQ layers its own inline
mini-grammars on top of plain block content (choice markers, feedback `>`
and comment `!` lines inside a single list item, the `[numeric(unit)]:`
tag, ...) that are not CommonMark constructs -- markdown-it has no idea
what a "feedback line" is, and in fact a run of `!`-prefixed lines
directly under a `>` blockquote gets lazily absorbed *into* the
blockquote's paragraph by CommonMark's lazy-continuation rule, which
throws away exactly the split we need. So once we know a block's *line
range* (`node.map`), we re-read those raw source lines ourselves for
anything with MDQ-specific syntax, rather than trusting markdown-it's
subtree for it. Plain prose blocks (preamble, stem, epilogue, choice/blank
text) are just reconstructed from their raw lines, soft-wrapped lines
joined with a single space -- the same collapsing a YAML folded (`>-`)
scalar does, which is how every paired `.yaml` fixture represents them.

The public functions below are thin wrappers around `ParseMDQ`, a
recursive-descent parser that walks a cursor over one question's block
children.

    Split the text below the title into (instructions, question blocks).

    A block starts at a `===` separator -- always, unconditionally -- or
    at a bare `---` frontmatter fence. Telling a fence-that-opens-a-new-
    question apart from a thematic break sitting in some other question's
    own preamble/epilogue prose (which generic.md allows outright) can't
    be done by content alone: an entirely ordinary prose line like "Nota:
    leia com atenção." parses as a YAML mapping just as readily as real
    frontmatter fields do, so a bare `---` only opens a *new* question
    when position says it structurally could:

    * it is the very first one found at all -- there is nothing yet to
      confuse it with, and exam.md's Body rule already forbids ordinary
      instructions prose from using a `---`-fenced block, so whatever
      fence is found first, however much instructions prose precedes it,
      is trustworthy; or
    * nothing but blank lines separates it from the line right after a
      *previous bare fence's own closing* `---` (exam.md's worked example
      chains two bare-frontmatter questions exactly this way, back to
      back, with no `===` between them); or
    * the current question (opened by `===` or a previous fence) has
      already shown a recognizable body -- a body tag (`[essay]`,
      `[short-answer]: ...`, `[numeric]: ...`, a `[^blank]:` line) or the
      first item of a bracket-choice list -- since its own frontmatter
      closed. Once that has happened the question is structurally
      complete (only optional epilogue prose can still follow), so a
      further bare fence safely opens the next question even with
      arbitrary epilogue text in between, no `===` required -- this is
      exactly what lets a duplicate-id check span two bare-frontmatter
      essay questions with real bodies, not just empty `include`s.

    A fence immediately after a `===`, with nothing but blank lines
    before it, is none of those: it is simply that question's own
    frontmatter (any question may have one, `===`-opened or not), not a
    second, separate start -- so it is consumed like normal content, not
    recorded as a new block, though a further fence chaining off *its*
    close is fair game again.

    Before any body tag has appeared for the current question, a bare
    `---` is necessarily still inside its own preamble/stem, and no
    signal available from raw lines can tell a thematic break there from
    a genuine fence -- so it is never treated as one.
