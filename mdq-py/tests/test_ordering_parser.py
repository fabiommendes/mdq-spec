"""
`mdq.parser`'s `[ordering]` body support: reading the tag, its content
block (fenced code or `ul`), the `## [extra]`/`## [accept]`/`## [reject]`
sections, and the indentation unit shared across all of them
(docs/question-types/ordering.md -- Body, Extra lines, Accepted/rejected
answers, Indentation).

The fixture-equality tests in `tests/test_parser.py`
(`test_parses_matches_fixture`) already cover the ten `examples/valid/
ordering/*.mdq.md` pairs' happy path -- this module does not repeat
them. What is here instead:

- a render -> parse property, tying cycle 3 (`OrderingQuestion.render()`)
  and cycle 4 (the parser) together: for a generated question, parsing
  its own rendered Markdown back must validate against the JSON schema
  and reproduce the normalized model.
- one focused test per parsing rule that carries a spec reason but that
  no fixture happens to pin exactly (see each test's docstring for the
  specific fixture-adjacent gap it fills).
- one test per malformed-body error the cycle-4 handoff calls out.
