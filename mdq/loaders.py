"""
Resolution of `include:` references from an exam.

An exam may pull in a question that lives elsewhere rather than writing it
inline. Where "elsewhere" is depends entirely on the host: a directory of
files, a database, an HTTP question bank. The parser therefore never looks
anything up itself -- it delegates to a `QuestionLoader`, and this module
provides the obvious filesystem implementation.
