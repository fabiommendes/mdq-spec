The Fibonacci sequence appears throughout nature, from sunflower seed
patterns to the branching of trees.

Write a Python function `fib(n)` that returns the n-th Fibonacci number,
with `fib(0) == 0` and `fib(1) == 1`. You may use either an iterative or
a recursive approach.

[essay]

Aim for a solution that runs in O(n) time.

## [answer-key]

A simple iterative solution:

```python
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a
```

A recursive solution is also acceptable, though it should ideally use
memoization to avoid exponential blow-up for large `n`.
