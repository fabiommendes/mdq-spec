`MDQ` defines a simple file format to declare questions for a LMS environment
using straightforward Markdown idioms. This has a similar scope as other formats
such as GIFT and AIKEN. However, by using Markdown as the underlying format, MDQ
users can leverage existing Markdown and (both human and LLM) familiarity with
this ubiquitous format.

`MDQ` files can declare single questions or exams. We distinguish each case by
file extension, using either `.mdq` or `.q.md` for the former and `.mde` or
`.e.md` for the latter.

This document describes the accepted questions formats and their respective
syntax. The `MDQ` project has a [Python reference implementation](https://github.com/codehood-lms/mdq.py) and a [Typescript implementation](https://github.com/codehood-lms/mdq.js). Each
have parsers that can be used to parse and validate `MDQ` documents.


## Questions formats

### Generic structure

A mdq exam file is a human-readable Markdown document that contains a series of
questions. Each question is declared using a header and an optional YAML
configuration section. The question body follows the configuration section and
can be written in Markdown.


```md
# [exam-id] Exam title

## Optional subtitle is a small description to show in listings, tables, etc.

One or more descriptive paragraphs. Any inline **markdown** *markup* is ~~valid~~.
These optional paragraphs are stored in the `preamble` attribute of the exam.

---

## [question-`id`] Question `title`

    # Yaml configuration section
    # This is an indented block of code interpreted as YAML and is used to
    # specify advanced options. The first block of comment in this section is
    # stored in the `comment` attribute for the question.
    type: multiple-selection  # (usually can be inferred from the body)
    format: md
    weight: 1.0
    grading: all-or-nothing
    shuffle: true

One or more descriptive paragraphs. Any inline **markdown** *markup* is ~~valid~~.
Those optional paragraphs are stored in the `preamble` attribute of the question.

The `stem` is the last paragraph before the question body. It usually commands the 
student to do some action (e.g., "Select all correct answers", "Write a program that...").

<QUESTION BODY, this depends on the question type>

The text after the body is stored in the `epilogue` attribute of the question.
```

The exam contains multiple questions, each separated by a horizontal rule (`---`).

### Multiple selection questions

```md
[Q1] What are the even numbers?
* [x] 2
* [ ] 3
* [x] 4
* [ ] 5
```

### Multiple choice

Multiple choice questions are declared using an unordered list:

```md
[Q1] How much is 2 + 2?
* 2 
* 3
* 4 ✅ 
* 5
```


### True/False questions

```md
[Q1] Judge the statements.
* [T] Markdown is a lightweight markup.
* [F] I'd rather be writing XML.
* [T] MDQ accepts True/False questions.
* [F] The Earth is flat.
```

### Fill in the blanks

```md
[Q1] 2 + 2 = [^value], which is an [^oddity]

[^value]:
  * 1 
  * 2 
  * 3
  * 4 ✅

[^oddity]:
  * odd
  * even ✅
```

### Associative questions

```md
[Q1] Associate the computations with their respective results

1 + 1 =
: 2

2 + 2 =
: 4

3 + 3 =
: 6
```

### I/O based E-judge questions

````md
[Q1] Create a program that asks the user for their name and prints "Hello <name>!".

## [io]

    @input $name

## [program]

```python
name = input("name: ")
print(f"Hello {name}!")
```
````

### Test based E-judge based questions

````md
[Q1] Create a function f that receives an integer and return twice its value.

## [test]

  compare: f

## [module]

```python
def f(x: int) -> int:
    return x + x
```
````



Advanced Features
=================

If necessary, users can specify additional information and use Markdown
markup.

```md
# Q1

    # An optional block of meta-information written in YAML
    slug: simple-sum 
    type: multiple-choice
    user-defined-attribute: 42

One or more descriptive paragraphs. Any inline **markdown** *markup* is ~~valid~~.
The exact flavor of supported Markdown depends on the target platform.

* Correct answer uses a `*` or `+` symbol.
- Incorrect choices uses a `-` symbol.
- (50%) Partial grades are specified as a percentage.
- The question may have multiple correct answers.
